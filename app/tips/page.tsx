      <p className='mx-10 my-2'>Welcome to our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Tips and Tricks hub! Whether you're a new islander or a seasoned resident, we’ve got all the insider tips you need to make your island thrive. From maximizing Bells and finding rare items to perfecting your island layout and keeping villagers happy, our guides will help you make the most of your gameplay. Dive in and turn your island into the paradise you’ve always dreamed of! Let's begin with some general tips!</p>

      <h1 className="text-center text-xl font-bold underline m-4 text-indigo-800"> Tip #1 </h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold m-4 text-blue-700"> Maximize Your Bells with the Stalk Market: </h2>
      <p className='mx-10 my-2'> Turnips are a great way to make big Bells fast! Buy them on Sundays from Daisy Mae and sell them during the week when prices peak. Use online turnip price calculators to predict high-value selling days, and visit friends’ islands to get the best prices.</p>
     
      <h1 className="text-center text-xl font-bold underline m-4 text-indigo-800"> Tip #2 </h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold m-4 text-blue-700"> Shake Trees Carefully: </h2>
      <p className='mx-10 my-2'> Shaking trees can give you hidden items like furniture and Bells, but it can also trigger wasps. Equip your net before shaking to catch wasps quickly if they appear. You’ll avoid stings and score some valuable wasp nests in the process.</p>
      
      <h1 className="text-center text-xl font-bold underline m-4 text-indigo-800"> Tip #3 </h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold m-4 text-blue-700"> Boost Resource Collection with Mystery Islands: </h2>
      <p className='mx-10 my-2'> Mystery islands are full of resources. Use Nook Miles Tickets to explore these islands, where you can gather materials like wood, stone, and iron. Some islands even have specific resources like bamboo, which you can’t get at home. Make sure to bring a shovel and an axe! </p>

      <h1 className="text-center text-xl font-bold underline m-4 text-indigo-800"> Tip #4 </h1>
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold m-4 text-blue-700"> Catch Rare Fish and Bugs Based on the Season: </h2>
      <p className='mx-10 my-2'>Every month brings new fish and bugs to your island, while some leave. Check the Critterpedia often to know what creatures are available and prioritize catching rare ones before they disappear. These rarer critters often sell for high prices or make great museum additions.</p>
